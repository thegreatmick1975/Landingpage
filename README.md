# Landingpage

This will be my first attempt at reverse engineering a website with the style, fonts etc provided, and I will build it based on my course work so far.
I will highlight some photos from a recent family trip to Florida to escape the Mid-West
winter.
I hope you enjoy our pics and thank you for taking the time to check out my code.
As I am new to HTML and CSS and insight or shortcuts would be totally welcome.
Many thanks again....1
